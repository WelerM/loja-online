# A PHP web application with MVC standard (Login, SQL)

Desription ( current on development ) 

The ideia behind this app is simple, but very interesting for creating a solid base on PHP and SQL, which are the main technologies that i'm trying to explore in this project.
In this app you will be able to save the clothes you have along with their information into the system, and then the system will provide you with randomly combinations of your clothes based on the current temperature from where you live, helping you to decide what to wear today, based on your own set of clothes. For you to start doing anything though, you will have to create an account and be logged to the system.
